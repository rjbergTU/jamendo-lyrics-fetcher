# jamendo-lyrics-fetcher
A small bash script I made to download lyrics for songs from jamendo.com. It uses the jamendo.com api.

This app is several years old, before I got to university, and was originally only meant for private use. I put it here in case someone else can use it.

It was made and tested under ubuntu. It requires several dependancies:

mp3info
eyeD3
curl
sed
